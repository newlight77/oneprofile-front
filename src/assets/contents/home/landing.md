### Why Oneprofile ?

As an engineer, a programmer, a software developer, then a coder, I have been struggling so much in my career, to just do the job as I have been paid for. I have walked through many experiences and obstacles, from the very first time I started writing code to the very last moment I'm writing code. What has change since 20 years? A lot! Because IT has changed, people have changed because of IT, and IT's changes are accelerating because people keeps changing.

If I look at the path I've been taken since I chosed to be a software engineer. I have learned so much. I would say it was unimaginable for me 20 ans ago to seen myself today. So what! I have evolved and I'm very happy to be at this point of level of skills. All these skills required a lot of practices. And practices of course aren't enough. There are many things to take in account to progress properly in software development world.
What are they ? In order words, what is a software developer ? How do we define a software developer ? What are his roles, his tasks, and his responsiblities ?

We will sort out all these questions, and we will understand why Oneprofile has been created. We will also define what is a programmer, a software developer, a coder, and at last, a craftsman.

#### A Developer's path

For anyone, all start with a choice. It's when we choose one among other profession. It doesn't matter at what age, what matter is the choice. Once decided, we must go on, all-in or else just quit and do something else. It's just normal and obvious, if we don't like what we do, we won't do any good about it and we won't go very far, at least not as far as our potential could enable.

If you are here reading this, you should be lost somehow or you hope to get in a better path. Don't get wrong, this is a not an express highway, it is a way to get where you should be. `All roads lead to Rome`. All paths or activities lead to the center of things. While reading this and following this crafts' platform intent, you will be leaded you to take your own path later on.
